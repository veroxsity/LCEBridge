LCEBridge is a Java 21 protocol bridge that lets unmodified Minecraft Legacy Console Edition clients connect to Minecraft Java Edition servers.

LCE Client <-> LCEBridge <-> Java Server
```

## Overview

The bridge translates between native LCE packets and modern Java Edition protocol traffic while preserving gameplay behavior as closely as possible. It is designed as a standalone runtime with protocol codecs, entity and inventory translation, world/chunk conversion, and mapping data generation all in one repository.

## Current Capabilities

- LCE login and session handling
- Java login and in-world join flow
- Launcher-provided online account handoff for Java online-mode servers
- Chunk translation and chunk streaming
- Block and item mapping
- Multiplayer entity synchronization
- Java-to-LCE chat and translated system message forwarding
- Standalone runtime packaging for public releases

## Repository Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `core/` | Packet codecs, session logic, mappings, and translation code |
| `bootstrap-standalone/` | Standalone runtime and application entrypoint |
| `tools/` | Mapping generation and maintenance scripts |

## Requirements

- Java 21
- Windows for the current local tooling and runtime workflow

## Build

Build everything:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build
```

Build the standalone runtime jar:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :bootstrap-standalone:shadowJar
```

The runnable artifact is written to:

```text
_build/bootstrap-standalone/libs/bootstrap-standalone-0.3.0.jar
```

Create the versioned release jar through the helper script:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-jar.ps1 --version v0.3.0
```

That writes the public release artifact into:

```text
scripts/output/bootstrap-standalone-0.3.0.jar
```

## Status

LCEBridge is usable for active multiplayer testing and public standalone releases, but it is still under development. Protocol coverage, gameplay parity, and edge-case compatibility across larger Java servers are ongoing work.
